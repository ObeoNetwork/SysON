|===
|*Hardware*
a|* For a small number of projects (less or equal to 10) and about 10-30 users, 100k semantic elements and 1000 representations in total: a recent server featuring a multicore CPU clocked at 2 GHz and equipped with 4 GB of available RAM, along with a reasonably fast hard drive (7200 rpm or faster) should cater for your needs.
** Minimum RAM: 4 GB
** Recommended RAM *8 GB* or more
** Minimum CPU: Dual-core processor
** Recommended CPU: *Quad-core* processor or higher
** Disk space: *10 GB* for installation
** *Additional disk* space for application data

* To enhance performance further, it is advisable to monitor {product} memory usage and allocate additional memory as needed.
In scenarios where your system anticipates a substantial volume of concurrent requests, deploying {product} applications on a multicore CPU machine becomes advantageous.
This strategy increases the concurrency of processing requests, ultimately leading to improved response times for your users.
Adjusting memory allocation and leveraging multicore capabilities contribute to optimizing the overall system responsiveness.
For more information, you can also refer to xref:user-manual:scaling-limits.adoc[Scaling {product}].

|*Operating System*
a|{product} is a pure Java-based application and should run on any supported operating system, provided that the JDK / JRE requirements are satisfied.

* Linux (64-bit), preferable distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
* Windows Server (64-bit), recommended versions include Windows Server 2016 or later : xref:anti-virus.adoc[Read Anti-Virus] in {product} applications.
|*Database*
a|To connect your {product} instance to an enterprise database, you must install and configure one of the following supported databases:

* *PostgreSQL 15*

Ensure that the server has a dedicated PostgreSQL database with admin rights.
|*Java Runtime Environment (JRE)*
a|You need to install and configure a separate JRE to run {product}, you have to install a supported version of the Java runtime:

* *Java 17* is essential for running the {product} Server.

We recommend utilizing the Java runtime provided by the https://adoptium.net/fr/temurin/releases/[Eclipse Temurin] project.

|*Network Connectivity*
|Stable internet connection for updates and communication with {product} Clients.

== Deployment recommendations

=== Latency: Client and Server

It is recommended to provide a network with the lowest possible latency between the client and the server.

=== Latency: Server and Database

To ensure optimal performance, we strongly recommend hosting both the server and database on the same physical server to minimize latency between the two components.

=== Network stability

VPN are not recommended (it is a latency factor) as well as other network elements that could drop connections which are more or less inactive.
As such wireless connection are also not recommended as any loss of connectivity might lead to instability in the product and loss of data.
However, if a network element of this kind is mandatory, an SSH tunnel could be used as a workaround to avoid client/server disconnections.

=== Server isolation

{product} should be the only way to edit the information stored in the database.

== Disclaimer

Notwithstanding what was stated previously, {product} is not warranted to run without any error or interruption.
Obeo does not make any warranty regarding the statements that are under the section <<Deployment recommendations>>, this section is provided for information purposes.

You acknowledge and accept the risks involved in using these products which could include without limitation, down time, loss of connectivity or data, system crashes, bad performances or performance degradation.
