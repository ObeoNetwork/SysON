= {product} key concepts and terminology

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental principles that shape the functionality of {product} offering essential insights into its core foundations.

== Project

In {product}, a *Project* serves as a high-level container that organizes <<Model,models>>.
You can utilize projects to group models, providing a structured and efficient way to manage your content.

NOTE: It is important to note that creating sub-projects within a project is not supported.

NOTE: All models exist at the same level within a project.

This design ensures simplicity and clarity in organizing and accessing your models, fostering a straightforward and intuitive project management experience.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product}, projects are _public_.
Public projects are visible by everyone.
====

== Model

In {product}, a model represents a comprehensive and structured representation of a system, capturing its various aspects, components, and relationships.
These models serve as fundamental building blocks for organizing and articulating the design, behavior, and structure of a system.
Notably, all models within {product} adhere to the {sysmlv2} language metamodel, ensuring compliance with standardized specifications.
This adherence to the {sysmlv2} metamodel enhances interoperability, consistency, and compatibility across the modeling landscape, making models integral components for effective system engineering and collaborative project development.

== Representation

In the context of {product}, a representation serves as a visual depiction or interpretation of a system, capturing specific aspects and viewpoints.
Essentially, it is one of the possible views within the {sysmlv2} framework.
Representations provide a means to illustrate and communicate diverse facets of a system, aiding in the comprehensive understanding of its structure, behavior, and relationships. These visual depictions play a pivotal role in model-based systems engineering, offering a nuanced and graphical approach to convey complex information in a more accessible manner.
Each representation within {sysmlv2} contributes to building a holistic understanding of a system's architecture and design.
