= Interoperability and Standard API

== Import / Export

=== JSON format

{product} extends its utility by introducing the capability to import and export projects in JSON format.
This feature enhances interoperability, allowing users to seamlessly exchange project data and collaborate with external tools or platforms.

WARNING: {product} does not currently support the {sysmlv2} Standard JSON format for import/export.

For detailed instructions on xref:hands-on/how-tos/download-project.adoc[downloading projects], xref:hands-on/how-tos/download-model.adoc[downloading models], xref:hands-on/how-tos/upload-project.adoc[uploading projects], and xref:hands-on/how-tos/upload-model.adoc[uploading models], please refer to the respective sections in the documentation.
These sections provide step-by-step guidance on how to perform these actions within the {product} environment.

=== {sysmlv2} textual format

Additionally, {product} envisions forthcoming support for {sysmlv2} textual specifications as an exchange format, anticipating a future where smooth transitions between tools will be facilitated.
This intent reflects {product}'s dedication to staying aligned with evolving industry standards.

An experimental add-on is under development to enable import/export functionality to and from {sysmlv2} textual syntax.
This feature will provide users with additional flexibility in their modeling workflows.
Stay tuned for updates on its availability in the project.

== {sysmlv2} Standard API

NOTE: Currently, the SysML v2 API is unavailable. For interoperability with SysON, utilize the provided file exchange format.

{product}'s vision includes a dedicated commitment to interoperability, with a future-oriented perspective on supporting standard APIs for seamless connections with a diverse array of modeling resources.
While the implementation of standard APIs is an aspect under consideration for future development, {product} aims to provide a foundation for fluid collaboration between different tools within the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) landscape.

As {product} progresses, these future developments in interoperability will further solidify its role as a collaborative platform, fostering an interconnected environment for MBSE practitioners.

The ongoing commitment to incorporating standard APIs and {sysmlv2} textual specifications underscores {product}'s dedication to providing users with a versatile and interoperable modeling solution.
