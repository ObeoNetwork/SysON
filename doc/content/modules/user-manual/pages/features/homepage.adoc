== What is the {homepage} ?

The **{homepage}** page serves as the pivotal starting point for your modeling endeavors and is the homepage of the {product} application, offering a central hub where users can seamlessly initiate new projects or manage existing ones.

== Find your way around

For newcomers to {product}, the initial experience of opening the application may seem a bit overwhelming.
To assist you in navigating effectively and initiating collaboration with your team, we offer a guided tour to help you acclimate to the platform.

We've streamlined the layout to provide a clear understanding of the content housed in each location.
