The {explorer} presents a hierarchical view of all models and their contents within the project, displayed as a tree structure with expandable and collapsible items.

* *Models*: Represented by the models existing in the specific project.
* *Semantic Elements*: Located within the models, these are instances of your business domain concepts, each with its own set of children.
* *Representations*: If a particular semantic element has an associated representation, such as a diagram, it will appear as a child of the semantic element.

== {explorer} Toolbar

At the top of the {explorer}, a toolbar provides quick access to essential actions:

* xref:hands-on/how-tos/create-model.adoc[Add a Model]: Enables the creation of a new model within the project.
* xref:hands-on/how-tos/upload-model.adoc[Upload a Model]: Allows users to upload and integrate an external model into the project.
* xref:hands-on/how-tos/sync-editor.adoc[Synchronize Editor] with Explorer: Ensures alignment between the explorer view and the editor, providing a seamless and up-to-date navigation experience.

== Selection

Users can select any item in the {explorer}:

* Selecting a *Semantic Element*: Displays its properties in the xref:features/details.adoc[Details] view.
If the element is represented on an open representation, the corresponding element (node or edge if it is a diagram) is also selected, and the chosen element is selected in the editor.
* Selecting a *Representation*: Opens it in a new tab or focuses on an existing tab where it was already open.
