= Synchronize {explorer} / {editor}

It is possible to disable (and of course re-enable) the synchronization between the {explorer} and the current selection in the {editor}.

When synchronization is enabled, if you selects an element inside a representation, the {explorer} view will ensure that the corresponding semantic element is visible and selected.
This can require expanding new tree items which were previously not visible or scrolling the {explorer}â€™s view.

When moving between elements in a representation, this can quickly result in an {explorer} view with many tree items expanded, which can be confusing.

The `Synchronize` toggle button in the {explorer} can be used to disable this synchronization.
When synchronization is disabled, tree items that are already expanded in the {explorer} will still be selected, but no new tree items will be automatically expanded.
