= Share a Project

Sharing a project is as straightforward as providing the project URL to someone because everything within {product} is public.
Once the project URL is shared, the recipient can access and view the project directly.
This simplicity in sharing allows for seamless collaboration and easy communication of project details without the need for complex sharing processes.
