= Rename an Element

It is possible to rename an element either from the {explorer}, the {details} view or a representation.

You can update the element name from the {explorer}:

. Click on the {explorer-menu} next to the element in the {explorer}.
. Select the `Rename` option.
. Update the name in the editable field.
. Click on `Rename`.

== From the {details} view

You can update the element properties from the {details} view:

. Select the property in the {details} view.
. Update the value in the editable field.
. Validate the changes by pressing the `RETURN` key or clicking anywhere.
.. Alternatively, cancel the operation by pressing the `ESC` key.

You can update the element name from a representation (diagram...):

. Select the element in the representation.
. Select the `Edit` tool in the {diag-toolbar}.
. Validate the changes by pressing the `RETURN` key or clicking anywhere.
