## Overview

The SysON project provides an open-source and interoperable tool for editing SysMLv2 models conforming to the OMG Standard, tailored for the MBSE community. It features a user-friendly web-based interface, offering a range of editors (graphical, form-based, etc.) to facilitate the creation, modification, and visualization of SysML v2 models. SysON leverages the [Sirius Web](https://eclipse.dev/sirius/sirius-web.html) platform and seamlessly integrates with other open-source solutions like Papyrus and Capella.
